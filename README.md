**Step 1: Install dependencies**

1. Download files

Goto https://discuss.haiku-os.org/t/progress-on-porting-firefox/13493/206 to get the two files: a .tar.bz2 and a .hpkg file.

2. Run a full upgrade in Haiku Depot.

3. Install the following packages using pkgman:
```bash
pkgman install atk dbus dbus_glib ffmpeg gettext_libintl glib2 graphite2 harfbuzz libnotify libpng16 pango pciutils libevent
```
If you encounter errors, you can check the syslog to determine which library is missing by running `cat /var/log/syslog`.

3. Install the attached `.hpkg` file. You may need to uninstall the pre-installed version that comes with Haiku R1/beta5. Simply double-click on the `.hpkg` file and click the "Uninstall" button in the Depot GUI.

**Important:** Be sure to check which packages were automatically removed by pkgman during this process and reinstall them manually.

**Step 2: Extract the Firefox compressed file .tar.bz2**

<br><br>

**Step 3: Launch Firefox**

firefox --no-remote --safe-mode --disable-gpu --disable-extensions --disable-smooth-scrolling --disable-restore-session-state --disk-cache-size=1048576 --disable-http-cache --disable-crash-reporter --disable-autofill-keyboard-accessory-view
